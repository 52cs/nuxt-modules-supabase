# Usage

This module exposes composables that are [auto-imported](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/composables) by Nuxt 3.

## `useSupabaseUser`

Once logged in, you can access your user everywhere:

```vue
<script setup>
const user = useSupabaseUser()
</script>
```

> Learn how to protect your routes by writing your own [auth middleware composable](/advanced#auth-middleware).

## `useSupabaseClient`

This composable is using [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/) under the hood, it gives acces to the [Supabase client](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/supabase-client).

### `auth`

All authentification methods are available on [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup) Documentation.

Here is an example of the login using the `signIn` method with [third-party providers](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers).

```vue [pages/login.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const client = useSupabaseClient()
const router = useRouter()

// Watch on user value, redirect to account page if exists
watchEffect(() => {
  if (user.value) {
    router.push('/account')
  }
})

// Login method using providers
const login = async (provider: 'github', 'google' | 'gitlab' | 'bitbucket') => {
  const { error } = await client.auth.signIn(authParams)

  if (error) {
    alert('Something went wrong !')
  }
}
</script>

```

<alert type="info">

Thanks to the [Nuxt plugin](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/plugins), we are listening to the [onAuthStateChange](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-onauthstatechange) listener in order to update the user value according to the received event. We also keep the session consistency between client and server side.   

</alert>

### `Database`

Please check [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select) documentation to fully use the power of Supabase client.

Here is an example of a fetch using the `select` method with Nuxt 3 [useAsyncData](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/data-fetching#useasyncdata) composable.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const client = useSupabaseClient()

const { data: { value: { data: restaurant } } } = await useAsyncData('restaurant', async () => {
  return await client.from('restaurants')
    .select('name, location')
    .eq('name', 'My Restaurant Name')
    .single()
})
</script>
```
