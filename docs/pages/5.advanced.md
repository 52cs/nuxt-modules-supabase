## Auth middleware

You can protect your authenticated routes by creating a custom composable in your project, here is an example:

```ts [middleware/useAuthMiddleware.ts]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, _from) => {
  const user = useStrapiUser()
  if (!user.value) {
    useCookie('redirect', { path: '/' }).value = to.fullPath
    return navigateTo('/login')
  }
})
```

Don't forget to reference your middleware in your page with:

```ts [pages/my-page.vue]
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'auth'
})
```
